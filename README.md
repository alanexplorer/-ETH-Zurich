# # Programming for Robotics - ROS

**Abstract:** This course gives an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS) including many of the available tools that are commonly used in robotics. With the help of different examples, the course should provide a good starting point for students to work with robots. They learn how to create software including simulation, to interface sensors and actuators, and to integrate control algorithms.

**Objective:**

-   ROS architecture: Master, nodes, topics, messages, services, parameters and actions
-   Console commands: Navigating and analyzing the ROS system and the catkin workspace
-   Creating ROS packages: Structure, launch-files, and best practices
-   ROS C++ client library (roscpp): Creating your own ROS C++ programs
-   Simulating with ROS: Gazebo simulator, robot models (URDF) and simulation environments (SDF)
-   Working with visualizations (RViz) and user interface tools (rqt)
-   Inside ROS: TF transformation system, time, bags

**Content:** This course consists of a guided tutorial and exercises with increasing level of difficulty when working with an autonomous robot. You learn how to setup such a system from scratch using ROS, how to interface the individual sensors and actuators, and finally how to implement first closed loop control systems.

# Exercise 1

5. Write a launch file with the following content (Lecture 1 Slides 27-30): husky simulation with a different world:
Include *​husky_empty_world.launch*​ file and change the ​world_name
Argument, e.g. *​worlds/robocup14_spl_field.world*​ a world from the
directory ​/usr/share/gazebo-7/worlds.
